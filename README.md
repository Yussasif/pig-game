``` PIG GAME ```
This Repository contains code for a ```PIG GAME``` which allows players to 
a die ðŸŽ² multiple times while switching between players and the player whose score 
is equal to or above 100 wins.

During the course of this project I learnt the concept of getting score and assigning 
it to the array of scores for each player

in this repository I include the flow chart of how the game is created.
Thanks
